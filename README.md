# Android MV*

### Branch: Version Three - Model-View-Presenter

Problems from version three that have been solved:
* ViewModel remains in memory on device rotation, so no need to re-do network call or database query each time!
* No view/presenter contracts necessary

Problems that remain in this version:
* Writing ViewModelFactories is a little cumbersome
